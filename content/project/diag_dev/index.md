A variety of diagnostics to understand laser-plasma interaction and laser fusion capsules has been developed including visible, UV, x-ray, particle and nuclear products measurements. We have been developing x-ray diagnostics using an intense short-pulse laser. One example is development of monochromatic flash x-ray radiography using a short-pulse laser.
