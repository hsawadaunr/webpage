Numerical simulations play an important role in understanding non-equilibrium plasma created by high-intensity, short-pulse lasers. To simulate fast electron transport and generation of hard x-rays, we perform particle and hybrid particle simulations with implicit particle-in-cell, multi-dimensional hybrid-PIC and Monte Carlo codes in collaboration with Prof. Y. Sentoku. Some of our publications using these simulations are following:
