## Course description

This course covers the fundamental physics of lasers such as laser oscillation, resonators and pumping mechanisms and related topics including optical coherence, photon statistics, non-linear optics and laser applications. 

## Student learning outcomes 

Upon successful completion of the course:
-	Students will be able to explain the basic physics of lasers such as the concept of atomic energy levels, spontaneous emission and stimulated emission, optical gain, and threshold condition for lasing.
- Students will be able to describe laser beam properties (Gaussian beams, the concept of optical coherence, including temporal coherence and spatial coherence).
- Students will be able to relate the principles of lasers to other physics subjects.
